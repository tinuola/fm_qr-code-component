# Frontend Mentor: QR Code Component

Solution to the _[QR Code Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H)_ challenge on Frontend Mentor.

### Challenge

- Build out a QR code component using provided [desktop](/assets/design/desktop-design.jpg) and [mobile](/assets/design/mobile-design.jpg) designs

### Solution

Live Site: [https://tinuola.github.io/fm_qr-code-component/](https://tinuola.github.io/fm_qr-code-component/)

### Retrospective

- Used a stronger gray for the component copy; the original `light-gray` was too low contrast for accessibility
- `Newbie` ranked Frontend Mentor challenges are fairly simple or straight-forward--usually! Since coding over a dozen of them, I've decided to use the remaining (and future ones) for speed challenges
- Estimate: 1 hour
- Actual completion: 35 minutes _(including project setup)_

### Enhancement(s)

- None planned
- Downloaded qr-code svg from Figma comp for potential animation practice

### Tools & Resources

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- CSS Resets
